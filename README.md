# ProfessorRatingsiOS
# This project has three major goals: including perspectives of students, professors and school administrative staff 
# in the application, ensuring the quality and fairness of student reviews and developing new features to differentiate 
# from similar applications in the marketplace. Based on the three goals, we created a complete working version of the 
# application on iOS, adding new features such as greying out unfair comments based the “dislike” to “like” ratio and a 
# suggestion section for students to post suggestions for courses.
